            <img class="profile_pic" src="assets/images/student_bio.jpg" alt="profile pic">

            <p>I would describe myself as an outgoing, charismatic, driven and goal oriented person. I love trying new things
                and having fun new adventures and experiences. I am a geek at heart with a love for Star Wars and Comics.
                I am fluent in Japanese and had the amazing opportunity to live there for 2 years on church service. Crazy
                story, I was there during the huge Tsunami and earthquake that hit Japan in 2011. But we had the amazing opportunity
                to help those in need and help rebuild what was lost. I love building computers and now gaining skills and
                knowledge in programming. I've truly found my passion in life and as I continue to grow and learn I'm excited
                to see where my new skills take me. </p>
